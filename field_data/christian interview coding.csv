1,". What do you usually pray for?
a) I usually don’t pray for specific things or seek psychological comfort. My prayers are more about saying whatever comes to mind; I generally don’t have specific requests. It’s more about expressing myself in a basic form of communication. Sometimes it’s just reporting on daily life, like casual chatting.
Speaker 1: Do you sometimes include wishes in your prayers?
Speaker 2: Based on my understanding of faith, I believe that wishes and blessings are already predetermined, so there’s no need to ask for them. Whether I ask or not, it doesn’t really make a difference.

2. What is your usual way of praying? For example, do you pray at home or in church? Do you feel certain rituals make prayers more effective, such as having a pastor’s blessing, being baptized, or taking communion? Do you think it’s necessary to pray aloud or assume a particular posture at specific times or places?
a) As I mentioned in my previous answer, I don’t follow any particular rituals. For me, prayer is a basic form of communication. My understanding of faith is that all needs in this life are already determined. What matters more is having a positive attitude in facing whatever happens in life. I am open to accepting whatever challenges come my way and don’t necessarily expect a better future. I believe that God knows what I need better than I do. Based on this belief, I don’t think rituals, settings, or having someone like a saint or pastor pray for me are necessary.

3. Over the years, has your approach to prayer or your faith in God changed? Have you become more devout, or have you experienced doubts?
a) One major change over the years is that I have shifted from making many requests in my prayers to focusing more on confession and gratitude. As I mentioned earlier, my casual conversations with God now include confession and thanksgiving. When I encounter situations that don’t align with what I believe to be God’s will, I pray for those situations as well. This has been a significant change. In the past, I used to pray for specific things like exams or health issues, but now I believe these matters are in God’s hands, and I no longer feel the need to pray for them.
Speaker 1: I think very few people have this perspective.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What experiences or events led to this change in your perspective?
Speaker 2: Through reading the Bible, especially the Gospel of Matthew, which states that our Heavenly Father knows everything we need. I believe the God I pray to is omniscient, omnipotent, and full of love, and our well-being is in His hands. In this context, my prayers now focus more on gratitude, confession, and interceding for broader issues such as injustice in the world. This is my current state of mind. I haven’t faced extreme difficulties recently, which could also be a factor, but my prayers now lean more toward these broader themes.

4. Optional question: If someone is a devout Christian, what situations or factors do you think could weaken their faith or even cause them to lose it?
a) It depends on their expectations of God. If they expect God to fulfill their needs and those expectations are not met, their faith might falter. Another factor is having misconceptions about faith. Some people place too much trust in reason, believing that if something doesn’t make sense logically, it cannot be true. However, Christian faith is not built on such a foundation. Some people believe in God because they experienced healing or because a serious illness was cured after collective prayers. Their faith is based on these events, but when they face adversity later in life, their faith may collapse. Others may try to reconcile faith with philosophical or rational thinking, and when things stop making sense to them, they become doubtful.

But in my understanding, faith is ultimately based on belief, which is not a subjective choice one can make independently. Belief comes from God’s own inspiration. I think the feeling of being touched or moved by God cannot be achieved by personal effort; it is an external influence beyond one's subjective control. Therefore, those who eventually leave the faith may not have fully understood it. Perhaps their faith was based on secondary factors rather than on the essence of faith itself. This is my personal understanding.",,1,,1,,
2,"1. What do you usually pray for?
a) There are a few parts to my prayers, such as thanksgiving, confession, and intercession—praying for others. Thanksgiving takes up a significant portion, followed by confession, while intercession tends to be relatively minimal.

2. What is your usual way of praying? Do you have specific times or settings? In what form do you pray—do you pray aloud, assume particular postures, or believe certain rituals make prayers more effective?
a) When participating in group activities, such as church gatherings or fellowship events, we usually stand together and bow our heads in a standard posture for prayer. Sometimes we pray aloud, and sometimes we don’t—it depends on the situation. I believe that whether I pray aloud or not doesn’t affect the essence of prayer.

For personal prayers, I have developed a habit of praying before meals and having nighttime prayers before sleep. Ideally, I think kneeling is the best posture for evening prayers, as it keeps me alert. However, since I am now married, my spouse and I have made an agreement to remind each other to pray together, as I find it difficult to maintain consistency on my own. We have a system where we alternate who leads prayers on specific days.

I’ve also found that during a period of severe insomnia, prayer helped me relax. Insomnia made my mind race with anxious thoughts, but when I prayed, it allowed me to clear my mind and I would often fall asleep while praying. I even apologized to God for using prayer as a way to fall asleep, but it helped me calm down and sleep peacefully. During that period, I would pray lying down, using prayer as a way to ease my mind, even though I rarely finished my prayers before falling asleep.

3. Over the years of your faith journey, has your approach to prayer or your belief in God changed—has it deepened, or have you experienced doubts?
a) I think my perspective has shifted. In our culture, prayer is often about making requests—asking for things that bring us anxiety. However, in the past couple of years, I’ve realized that many things have already been taken care of by God. I've come to understand that making requests is not the essence of faith.

I’ve noticed that many people around me, including elders, tend to treat faith in a way similar to folk religion—believing in multiple deities and choosing to pray to whichever one they feel is more effective. They pray simply out of habit, seeking results. But I have gradually realized that the more I pray, the less I focus on asking for things, and the more I focus on gratitude. I believe thanksgiving allows me to reflect on the things God has already accomplished in my life, which brings me a sense of contentment and fulfillment. This deeper understanding of faith has shifted my prayers from seeking to appreciating.

Speaker: What experiences or events led to this transformation in your prayer habits?
b) Reading the Bible has been a key factor. In many instances, Jesus instructs us to seek God's kingdom and righteousness first, rather than asking for material things like children, marriage, or wealth. Through studying the Bible, I realized that my prayers were often based on my own imagination rather than what God actually wants us to pray for.

Additionally, my life experiences, such as illness, have taught me that prayer should not be judged by whether it ""works"" or not. If prayer is used as a means to achieve a specific outcome, then it turns into a form of superstition. True faith is about ""walking together"" with God rather than treating Him as someone who grants wishes only when we ask correctly.

4. Optional question: In your opinion, what circumstances or situations could weaken a devout Christian's faith or even lead them to lose it?
a) Significant life crises—such as the breakdown of relationships, family conflicts, or severe illness—could lead a person to question God when they encounter situations they find unbearable. Emotional turmoil during such events can impact their faith.

Another factor could be exposure to new ideas and perspectives. Encountering different worldviews, engaging in new conversations, or adopting alternative values might lead someone to question their original faith.

A third factor is disappointment within the religious community. Many believers assume that within a faith-based group, everyone should be kind, friendly, and loving. However, if they experience hurt or betrayal within the church community, they may become disillusioned with both the group and their faith in general. Such cases are quite common, as people often place their trust in others within the community, expecting them to embody faith fully. However, human expressions of faith are often incomplete, and these shortcomings can deeply affect others.",1,,1,,1,
3," What do you usually pray for?
a) Thanksgiving and silence. What do I mean by silence? In the past, I used to ask God for things. But later, my prayers became more about either expressing gratitude or simply remaining silent—just wanting a quiet moment without saying anything.

2. What is your usual way of praying? Do you have specific times or settings? Do you pray aloud or assume particular postures? Do you believe that certain rituals, such as baptism or taking communion, make prayers more effective?
a) No, I don't have any specific requirements. I can pray anytime, anywhere. I don’t think of prayer as something that must produce results; rather, it’s more of an expression of intention.

3. Over the years of your faith journey, has your belief in prayer and God changed? Has it deepened, or have you experienced doubts?
a) This is something I can’t really describe, you know? It’s not about whether my faith has deepened or weakened; rather, it has fluctuated in another, more subtle direction. I still believe in God, but I wouldn’t say I believe strongly or weakly—just that I believe. However, the way I walk my path has changed. For example, I now think about faith in relation to my worldview, pondering the existence of God and what it means to become divine. My understanding of faith deepens gradually and subtly; it’s something innate, an attraction that grows over time.

4. Optional question: In your opinion, what circumstances or situations could weaken a devout Christian's faith or even lead them to lose it?
a) Let me think about this. I believe it happens when God’s “persona” collapses—when He turns out to be different from what one imagined. If God is analyzed and shown to have flaws, it can shake a believer’s faith. For example, whether through scripture or real-life experiences, if people discover that God does not match the original descriptions, their faith can falter.

The most critical factor, I think, is when someone realizes that God is not as just or holy as they believed, or if they come to the conclusion that God is not truly loving and compassionate. This realization can ultimately lead them to lose faith.",,,1,,,
4,"1. What do you usually pray for?
a) My daily prayers are generally divided into two parts: morning and evening. In the morning, I usually pray for the day ahead, for my family, and for the people and matters that need intercession. In the evening, most of my prayers are about giving thanks—being grateful for getting through the day safely and for the many blessings received. This is my general pattern of prayer.

2. What is your usual way of praying? Do you have specific times or settings?
a) When I’m busy, such as when picking up and dropping off my children, I pray while driving. When I’m making milk for my child, I also take the opportunity to pray. My habit is to have a quiet prayer session in the morning after waking up and another quiet prayer before going to sleep.

At other times, I pray anytime and anywhere—whenever I see something that moves me emotionally, I pray immediately. There isn’t a fixed pattern or requirement. However, when something significant happens, such as going to church, I kneel on the mat in front of the cross to pray. When I visit religious sites or churches while traveling, I also kneel in prayer.

In general, there is no rigid framework for my prayers. Silent prayer is also a common practice for me—when I am in a noisy environment where it’s inconvenient to pray aloud, I pray silently in my heart. This flexibility allows me to integrate prayer into my daily life.

3. Over the years, has your belief in prayer and faith in God changed? Have you experienced deepening faith, doubts, or uncertainties?
a) My personal faith has been a process of gradual deepening. This is closely related to my upbringing in a Christian family. Initially, my understanding of faith was primarily passed down from the older generation. However, after personally engaging with faith, being moved internally, and eventually getting baptized, my desire for truth grew stronger. This journey significantly changed my prior understanding.

Reflecting on my experiences, I can say that my faith has evolved and deepened over time. Initially, my understanding of God was based on scripture and teachings passed down by elders, but after experiencing faith firsthand, I underwent a qualitative leap in my relationship with God.

4. Optional question: In your opinion, what circumstances or experiences could weaken a devout Christian’s faith or even lead them to doubt or abandon it?
a) Based on my limited personal understanding, I believe that if the Holy Spirit does not dwell within a person, they will inevitably stray from the truth. The power of the Holy Spirit is essential—it must be continually sought from God, as it provides the strength to walk the path of faith. Without it, one is vulnerable to the temptations of the world and Satan.

To pursue faith and truth with steadfastness, one must rely on the power of the Holy Spirit. Another crucial aspect is the personal relationship one establishes with God through life experiences. This relationship is what sustains a believer on their spiritual journey. Without this foundation, it is easy to be swayed by temptations and stray from the right path.
",,,,,,
5," What do you usually pray for?
a) My prayers generally include several aspects. First, I express gratitude for the blessings I have received recently. Then, I pray for my upcoming needs—such as having good energy the next day, as I tend to struggle with insomnia. Additionally, I include intercessory prayers, such as praying for long-term service to God or for friends experiencing sudden illnesses. I also pray for my family’s needs, reflect on the blessings I have received, confess my mistakes, and ask God for forgiveness. I may also pray for my academic performance.

2. What is your usual way of praying? Do you have specific times or settings? Do you pray aloud or silently? Do you assume particular postures or believe certain rituals, such as baptism or a pastor's blessing, make prayers more effective?
a) Since I am not yet an adult—I will be soon—I have not been baptized yet, but I plan to be baptized when I come of age. I can, however, share my observations of people around me. Some of them feel guilty if they miss a monthly baptism service, as if they are letting God down. They might make a special effort to get baptized as a result.

As for my own prayer habits, I usually pray before sleeping, after waking up, and before meals. In the morning and evening, I kneel to pray, whereas during the day, I typically sit. At night, I pray together with my mother. If unexpected situations arise, I pray silently; when the setting allows, I prefer to pray aloud. I generally lean towards praying aloud when possible.

Regarding rituals such as baptism or pastoral prayers, many people believe that pastors have special authority, making their prayers seem more effective. However, I personally believe that God is fair to everyone, and each person can pray to Him directly. That said, praying with a pastor or others allows for sharing and mutual encouragement, creating a sense of collective strength. I don’t feel it is necessary to always pray with others, but I do prefer group prayer for the sense of community and reassurance it provides.

3. Over the years, has your belief in prayer and faith in God changed? Have you experienced a deepening of faith, doubts, or uncertainties?
a) So far, I haven't experienced any doubts, as I am still young and haven’t encountered many hardships. However, I do feel that in times of difficulty, when I am emotionally overwhelmed, I can genuinely sense God’s presence—comforting me and staying by my side. During such moments, my prayers become more intense and sincere.

As I grow older and learn more about religious teachings, I increasingly feel that God's guidance is good for me. The more I learn about His nature, the better I understand how I should act and approach my faith.

4. Optional question: In your opinion, what circumstances or experiences could weaken a devout Christian’s faith or even lead them to doubt or abandon it?
a) It depends on the situation. If a person's spiritual foundation is not strong enough, encountering difficulties can easily lead to doubt. Many people turn to religion believing that faith will bring them blessings and prevent hardships, or that illnesses will be healed through prayer. When such expectations are not met, their faith may waver. This happens because they are unaware that Christians, like everyone else, experience suffering. Although God provides protection, trials are still part of life—some of which are meant to help believers grow spiritually.

For those whose faith is not deeply rooted, they may have initially believed based on testimonies without fully understanding the faith. When reality does not align with their expectations, they may easily become disillusioned.

Another factor that could shake faith is witnessing respected religious figures, such as pastors, making mistakes. People might think, ""Aren’t they supposed to be role models?"" This can lead to disappointment, forgetting that pastors are human and still prone to sin. Although God forgives them, people often hold them to higher standards. However, pastors are not fundamentally different from the rest of us; they simply have more spiritual knowledge and serve as guides, much like an older sibling in a family who can also make mistakes.

Ultimately, faith should be centered on God, not on individuals. God is eternal and unchanging, whereas people are fallible. Many people lose faith because they focus too much on the actions of pastors or churches. They may leave one church for another, only to encounter similar issues elsewhere, and eventually abandon their faith altogether.
",1,1,1,,,
6,"1. What do you usually pray for?
a) I pray for the Lord to calm my heart. I also have some specific requests for the Lord regarding important matters, hoping for His protection and guidance. Additionally, I commit my concerns to Him.

2. What is your usual way of praying? Do you have specific times or settings? Do you pray aloud or silently? Do you believe prayer is more effective at home or in church, or after certain rituals such as baptism or a pastor's blessing?
a) I usually pray in the morning after reading the Bible. Sometimes I write down my prayers and post them in my prayer group. In my fellowship, we take turns leading vocal prayers every two weeks or so. Generally, I pray more silently at home.

3. Over the years, has your belief in prayer and faith in God changed? Has it deepened, or have you experienced doubts? If so, what events or experiences led to these changes?
a) My faith has deepened. The more I read the Bible and understand it on a deeper level, the more I recognize the Lord’s power and wisdom. This growing understanding has made me more willing to entrust my life to Him.

4. Optional question: In your opinion, what circumstances or experiences could weaken a devout Christian’s faith or even lead them to lose it?
a) I believe the most important reason lies within oneself. When faith is lost, it may be because a person feels weak or becomes influenced by external factors, going along with societal pressures. They might feel that their faith is no longer beneficial to them and gradually conform to worldly values.

Another factor could be negative examples from fellow believers. If their testimonies are not positive or fail to reflect genuine faith, it may also have a negative impact on others' beliefs.",,,,,1,
7,"1) What do you usually pray about?
Let me think...
First, I pray about my studies.
Then, about family matters—both big and small things happening at home,
as well as health-related concerns.
Finally, it depends on different periods,
I pray about different worries depending on the stage I’m going through.

So, are these usually concerns that you hope God will help you with,
or are you looking for inner peace?

It depends on the situation.
If it’s about exams or academic matters,
I pray for things to go smoothly and for God to guide my future path.
But if it's something I haven’t figured out myself,
something where I don't know the best course of action,
then I just ask God to guide it according to what He thinks is best,
rather than what I want.

2) How do you usually pray?
For example, do you prefer praying at home or in church?
Do you pray aloud or silently?
Do you have a preferred prayer posture,
and do you have specific times for prayer?

For me, it's mostly at home, usually before bed.
I typically kneel while praying.
Most of the time, I pray with family—either with my mom or my grandma,
so it's often two or three people praying together.
I rarely pray alone.

However, during family gatherings,
like once a week at family fellowships or church meetings,
there might be eight or nine people praying together.
When I'm with family, I pray out loud,
but when I'm alone, I usually pray silently.

Do you ever pray in your dormitory at university,
or is it mostly when you're back home?

I pray more when I’m back home.
Since starting university, my prayer frequency has decreased a lot.
I tend to pray more when facing problems that I find difficult to handle,
but compared to my high school days,
when I was with my family daily, I pray much less now.

Do you think prayer is more effective after certain rituals,
such as a pastor's blessing, baptism, or taking communion?

I think praying after singing hymns is more effective.
It helps me get into the right state of mind,
and I feel more engaged,
so I end up saying more in my prayers.

If I don’t sing before praying,
it can sometimes be harder to focus.

In church, I actually find it harder to get fully involved,
because there are too many people,
and there are often other activities going on afterward.
I prefer praying during family fellowships,
where we all sit around a table and take turns praying aloud.
It feels more sincere when others are praying for you,
and it makes me take it more seriously.

3) Over the years, has your faith in prayer and God changed?
Have you experienced any deepening of faith or doubts?

Because I was born into a Christian family,
faith has always been a very natural part of my life.
Before I developed my own independent thinking,
faith was something I accepted without question.

When I was in middle school,
I faced challenges in my studies and personal life,
and during that time,
I found that praying really helped me.
I felt that through prayer, my problems were either solved,
or at least my heart found peace.
This deepened my faith.

However, in high school and especially after entering university,
I felt like I drifted away from my faith.
I started encountering more controversial issues,
such as conflicts between modern values and traditional religious beliefs.
I had more doubts,
but I didn’t have a suitable platform or people around to help answer my questions.
This made me feel somewhat distant from my faith.
But deep down, I still believe—
I just need some guidance to help me understand things better.

What specific experiences or events have influenced these changes?

A major turning point for me was going to university.
I suddenly lost the spiritual companionship of my family,
who used to encourage me to pray and study the Bible regularly.
Without that structure, I lacked motivation,
and there was no one to remind me to stay consistent.
Plus, I had lingering doubts in my mind,
which made me even less motivated to engage in faith-based activities.
Going to university was a significant dividing line for me.

4) Lastly, what kind of events or circumstances might weaken a devout Christian's faith,
or even lead them to lose their belief?

Let me think…
You mean someone who truly believes in God from the bottom of their heart, right?

Yes, someone who actively practices their faith by reading the Bible,
attending church, and engaging in religious activities.

I think a major life crisis could shake their faith,
especially if things take a turn for the worse.
They might question why they are facing such hardships
despite their devotion to God.
They may struggle to understand why God allows such difficulties,
and over time, they could drift away from their faith.

A real-life example could be my uncle.
He met my aunt in a church choir in the UK,
and back then, they were both very devout.
However, after returning to China and going through challenges
such as job hunting, work struggles, and raising a child,
his faith seemed to weaken.
I often hear my family members say that
""his faith isn't as strong as before.""
He still goes to church,
but in daily conversations,
you wouldn't really think he’s a Christian anymore.",1,,,,,
8,"1. What do you usually pray for?
a) I usually pray for God’s blessing when I have upcoming exams, and if I face stress related to my studies or social interactions—like conflicts with friends—I pray for God’s guidance on how to handle them. I find that praying helps reduce my stress.

Interviewer: Do you tend to pray more for psychological comfort and stress relief, or do you focus more on practical matters, such as performing well in an exam or addressing real-life concerns?
Interviewee: I think I pray for both, but more often I pray for real-life situations. However, when I feel stressed, praying brings me a sense of peace and reassurance.

2. What is your usual way of praying? Do you usually pray at home or in church? Do you pray aloud or silently? Do you prefer a particular posture or specific times and settings?
a) I usually pray silently while sitting on my bed before sleep. I feel that prayers might be more effective after receiving a pastor's blessing—perhaps subconsciously, I believe it helps.

Since I attend a church-affiliated school, when I feel anxious about my studies, my teachers sometimes pray with me. I think having a leader guiding me in prayer gives me a sense of security and makes me feel that the prayer is more effective, though this might be a psychological effect.

3. Over the years, has your belief in prayer and faith in God changed? Has it deepened, or have you experienced doubts?
a) There have been moments of doubt. For example, when I work hard and pray consistently for something, but the result doesn’t meet my expectations, I feel very disappointed and briefly question whether God is truly helping me.

However, after living in Australia for several years, I have come to realize the importance of prayer as a source of spiritual support. When there is no one else to rely on, prayer makes me feel that God is there to help me.

Interviewer: What experiences led to these changes?
Interviewee: Situations where my prayers were not answered as I hoped, despite my efforts, have caused me to experience some doubts and small setbacks in my faith.

4. Optional question: In your opinion, what circumstances or experiences could weaken a devout Christian’s faith or even lead them to doubt or abandon it?
a) I think this varies from person to person. In my opinion, as long as faith is present in someone’s heart, they will continue to hold on to it. It usually takes a significant setback to shake someone’s faith. Unless their faith is already weak, it is not easy to be swayed.
",1,,,,,
9,"1. What do you usually pray for?
a) My usual prayers are for my family’s health. If I have an upcoming exam, I pray for good results. There’s nothing particularly special about my prayers; they’re mostly for psychological comfort. When something is about to happen, praying gives me a sense of reassurance and helps me feel less anxious. It’s like entrusting things to God, and then I can feel at ease.

2. What is your usual way of praying? Do you pray at home or in church? Do you pray aloud or silently? What posture do you prefer, and do you have specific times or settings?
a) When I pray in church, I usually sit and pray. At home, I typically pray before going to sleep, sitting on my bed and praying silently to myself or softly aloud. In church, when praying with others, I usually pray aloud.

In school, we had Bible classes where we would form a circle and take turns praying aloud. However, when I pray alone, I don’t usually say my prayers out loud.

Interviewer: Do you think prayer is more effective after certain rituals, such as a pastor's blessing, taking communion, singing hymns, or being baptized?
Interviewee: I don't think there's much of a difference. As long as you have the right intentions, I believe it’s all the same.

3. Over the years, has your belief in prayer and faith in God changed? Has your faith deepened, or have you experienced doubts or wavering?
a) I don’t think I’m as devout as I was in elementary school. My mom is, how should I say it... what we might call an ""over-Christian."" Sometimes it feels a bit overwhelming. I still believe in God, but I’m not as involved in religious activities as I used to be. When I was younger, I used to read the Bible and pray with my mom every night, but now I do it less frequently.

Interviewer: Were there any specific events or experiences that led to this change?
Interviewee: Let me think… I think it's mainly because of family influences. My dad isn’t very religious, and sometimes he and my mom would have conflicts over religious matters, which may have affected me. Also, when I was in elementary school back home, religious activities were part of my routine, but after moving abroad and becoming busy with my studies, I participated in fewer religious activities.

Back in elementary school, I enjoyed choir practice—it was also a way to hang out with friends and enjoy the atmosphere. When I first arrived in Australia, I couldn’t speak English well, so I didn’t join youth fellowship groups. The church my mom attended here mainly had elderly people, which didn’t provide the same atmosphere. Over time, I gradually participated less.

It’s also about the social circle—when my friends were mostly from church, I participated in religious activities more often, since gatherings were centered around church events.

4. Optional question: In your opinion, what circumstances or experiences could weaken a devout Christian’s faith or even lead them to doubt or abandon it?
a) I think it could be continuous setbacks in life—when someone doesn't feel they are receiving a tangible response to their prayers. If they don't see improvements in their situation after praying, it could affect their faith.

Life’s challenges and a lack of feedback from prayer might lead to doubts about their faith.",1,1,,,,
10,"1. What do you usually pray for?
a) I often pray for our church, hoping it will continue to grow and that everyone’s faith will become stronger. I also pray for my family and for friends around me who are in need. If they have specific needs, I will intercede for them in prayer.

Interviewer: Do your prayers focus more on seeking psychological comfort, or do you mainly pray for practical matters in daily life?
Interviewee: I tend to focus more on practical issues in life. I believe that when the problems around us are resolved and we receive help, our hearts naturally feel at peace. I think having our real-life concerns addressed helps improve our mood.

2. What is your usual way of praying? Do you pray at home or in church? Do you pray aloud or silently? Do you have specific postures, times, or settings?
a) I don’t have a fixed way of praying. I pray anytime and anywhere whenever I feel the need. Sometimes I pray silently, and sometimes I pray while driving or before sleeping. I also pray when I’m alone or whenever I feel the desire to pray. There’s no set rule—it's quite flexible. I also often pray during gatherings.

Interviewer: Do you believe that certain rituals, such as a pastor's blessing, taking communion, or singing hymns, make prayer more effective?
Interviewee: I don’t really focus on that aspect. Personally, I feel peace and strength whenever I pray, regardless of whether it’s in church or during a service. However, sometimes when I pray with family or during worship, I may feel a deeper sense of connection—especially when reading relevant Bible passages or when I have been earnestly praying for something and I see an improvement. In such moments, I feel immense gratitude and a greater desire to pray.

Overall, prayer gives me a deep sense of strength and peace. I don’t believe that prayer is more effective in specific locations or conditions; rather, when I have a strong spiritual connection, prayer feels especially profound and miraculous.

3. Over the years, has your belief in prayer and faith in God changed? Has your faith deepened, or have you experienced doubts?
a) I have never doubted my faith; it has only deepened over time. I have never wavered in my belief.

Interviewer: Were there specific events or experiences that deepened your faith?
Interviewee: Yes, many experiences in daily life have reinforced my faith. Through these experiences, I deeply feel God’s love and realize that He has never abandoned me. I have received so much grace, and my faith has only grown stronger with time.

4. Optional question: In your opinion, what circumstances or experiences could weaken a devout Christian’s faith or even lead them to doubt or abandon it?
a) Personally, I haven't experienced any doubts about God. However, I have felt a sense of powerlessness when those around me—family or friends—question their faith. At such moments, I feel helpless and wish they could understand my beliefs.

When people close to me struggle with doubts, it can be challenging, but it has never made me question my own faith. Instead, I pray for God to give me the strength to influence and support them, hoping that God Himself will guide them.

For me, doubting God would only weaken my strength, and I am determined not to let that happen. No matter what circumstances I face, I do not question Him because I know doing so would leave me feeling even weaker.
",,,,,,
11,"1. What do you usually pray for?
a) I usually pray for my entire family—for my parents' work, especially for the health of my elderly relatives, and for my brother’s and my studies. That’s generally what I pray for at home.

Interviewer: Do you pray more for psychological comfort, or do you focus more on practical aspects of life?
Interviewee: I focus more on practical matters, praying for real-life situations because I find them more tangible.

2. What is your usual way of praying? Do you have specific times or settings, such as at home or in church? Do you pray aloud or silently? Do you have a preferred posture, and do you believe prayer is more effective under certain conditions?
a) In the evening, my family and I pray together at home, and we pray aloud. When I’m in bed, I also pray silently by myself.

Interviewer: Do you feel that certain rituals make prayer more effective, such as taking communion, singing hymns, or receiving a pastor's blessing?
Interviewee: I feel that prayer is more effective after taking communion or before and after reading the Bible. It helps me get into the right mindset.

3. Over the years, has your belief in prayer and faith in God changed? Have you experienced deepening faith, or have you had doubts or uncertainties?
a) I feel that during major life events, prayer becomes especially important. These experiences have made me more committed to praying every day and expressing my needs to God.

Interviewer: Have any specific events or experiences caused changes in your faith or prayers?
Interviewee: Sometimes, when I pray and don’t receive an immediate answer, I may experience doubts. However, in the end, I always feel that God eventually helps me. So while I have had moments of doubt, they were not significant, and in fact, they have ultimately strengthened my faith.

4. Optional question: In your opinion, what circumstances or experiences could weaken a devout Christian’s faith or even lead them to doubt or abandon it?
a) I had a friend whose mother was very devoted to church service, frequently participating in church activities and praying consistently. However, she spent less time with her family. When her mother became seriously ill, my friend prayed earnestly for her recovery, but despite their prayers, her mother passed away. This experience led my friend to lose faith in God because she felt that despite her mother’s devotion and faithfulness, God did not heal her. She struggled to believe in God's help after that.",,1,,,,concrete case of someone losing faith in God due to unanswered prayers
12,"1) What do you usually pray about?
What do I usually pray about? I think it covers various aspects.
First, I pray to draw closer to God.
Then, I pray for my family and intercede for brothers and sisters in the church community.
I also pray for the world and its circumstances.
These are the main areas.

Do you focus more on seeking emotional comfort and solace in prayer,
or do you pray more for practical matters in life?

Both.
It’s not something I do intentionally; it depends on the situation.
If something comes to mind, I’ll pray about it.
It’s actually like having a conversation.

2) How do you usually pray?
For example, do you have specific times or places to pray,
like at home, in church, or during fellowships?

No, not really. I pray anytime, anywhere.
For example, I pray while driving to work in the morning,
or when I’m alone in the car before starting the engine.
Whenever I’m alone,
I tend to think about praying more.

Do you think prayer is more effective after certain rituals,
such as taking communion, singing hymns,
or receiving a pastor’s blessing?

I don’t specifically think about effectiveness,
but those moments do make me feel more emotional.
For example, when we gather together and worship,
I often feel deeply moved.
I definitely feel that I am in a better state then,
and I sense the Holy Spirit’s presence.

3) Over the years, has your faith in prayer and God changed?
Have you experienced any deepening of faith or any doubts?

I haven’t experienced doubt.
I’ve known God for many years—
I’m older now,
so my faith hasn’t really changed fundamentally.
But, how should I put it...
there have been times when I ""argued"" with God.
When things happen that I feel shouldn’t,
I complain to Him.
But after venting, things eventually get better.

4) Lastly, what kind of events or circumstances might weaken a devout Christian's faith,
or even lead them to lose their belief?

It depends on how deep their faith is.
If their foundation is shallow,
then setbacks and hardships might easily shake their trust in God.
For example, facing major difficulties,
or encountering obstacles they feel they can’t overcome.
Such experiences might lead them to doubt.

But I believe that many times,
it’s actually God who is holding onto us.
It’s not something we can sustain by our own strength.
Even when we hit rock bottom,
we might feel like we’re losing faith,
but God is still leading us forward step by step,
even without us realizing it.

13," What do you usually pray for?
a) My prayers cover various aspects. One is to draw closer to God, another is intercessory prayer for my family, for my church community, and for the needs of fellow brothers and sisters in the faith. I also pray for global issues and the world’s environment. These are the main things I pray about.

Interviewer: Do you tend to seek psychological comfort and solace in prayer, or do you focus more on practical matters in life?
Interviewee: I think it's a mix of both. I don’t deliberately focus on one aspect—it depends on the moment. I pray about whatever comes to mind, kind of like having a conversation with God.

2. Do you have specific times or settings for prayer, such as at home, in church, or during fellowship?
a) No, I pray anytime and anywhere—whenever I have a moment, such as when I’m driving to work in the morning or when I'm alone. I often pray when I start the car before heading to work or whenever I have some quiet time to myself.

Interviewer: Do you think prayer is more effective after certain rituals, such as taking communion, singing hymns, or receiving a pastor's blessing?
Interviewee: Not necessarily, but I do feel a sense of spiritual connection during worship. When we worship together, I often feel deeply moved, and it helps me enter into a state where I feel the presence of the Holy Spirit more strongly.

3. Over the years, has your belief in prayer and faith in God changed? Has it deepened, or have you experienced doubts?
a) I haven't had doubts. My understanding of God has remained consistent over the years—after all, I’ve been a believer for many years, and my faith hasn’t changed.

However, there have been times when I’ve argued with God, especially when facing situations that I felt shouldn’t have happened. I might get upset and ""argue"" with Him, but eventually, things get resolved, and my faith remains strong.

4. Optional question: In your opinion, what circumstances or experiences could weaken a devout Christian’s faith or even lead them to doubt or abandon it?
a) It depends on the strength of their faith foundation. If their faith is shallow, they might lose trust in God when facing significant adversity.

For example, if they experience a major setback and feel unable to overcome it, they might struggle with their faith. However, I believe that, in many cases, it is God who sustains us—it’s not entirely our own strength that keeps us going.

During difficult times, we might feel weak, but I think God gently pulls us forward even when we’re unaware of it, helping us get through challenges.
",1,,,,,
14,"1. What do you usually pray for?
a) I usually pray for the progress of church ministries, for my family—for their safety and success in their careers. My prayers are more focused on practical matters in life rather than seeking spiritual comfort. I tend to pray for specific things.

2. What is your usual way of praying? Do you have specific times or settings, such as praying at home or in church? Do you pray aloud or silently? Do you have a preferred posture?
a) I pray before meals, and when I go to church, there is always time for prayer. At home, I have a longer prayer session before going to sleep, usually kneeling with my mother. Most of the time, I pray aloud rather than silently. However, sometimes I switch between praying aloud and silently depending on the situation—there’s no fixed rule.

Interviewer: Do you think prayer is more effective after certain rituals, such as receiving a pastor’s blessing, singing hymns, or taking communion?
Interviewee: I don't think it works that way. Prayer is about a relationship with God, nurtured through daily spiritual practices like reading the Bible and prayer. It's not about performing certain actions to make prayers more effective or heard.

3. Over the years, has your belief in prayer and faith in God changed? Have you experienced deepening faith or moments of doubt?
a) I believe that faith fluctuates over time. It’s unrealistic to maintain the same level of devotion continuously. For example, when I get busy with work, I may have less time to read the Bible, and my engagement with faith may decrease. However, when life presents challenges—such as when my mother had a car accident—I feel a stronger need to seek God’s help through prayer.

My faith has not wavered completely; it's more of an ebb and flow. Sometimes I feel more distant, and other times I feel more passionate about my faith.

4. Optional question: In your opinion, what circumstances or experiences could weaken a devout Christian’s faith or even lead them to doubt or abandon it?
a) I believe every believer might experience doubt at some point in their faith journey. This is understandable given the influence of secular ideologies such as atheism, materialism, and exposure to different religious beliefs.

I’ve observed some Christians leave the faith after experiencing hardships, such as a loved one’s illness. For instance, some have fervently prayed for healing, but when their prayers were not answered as they hoped, they began to question their faith. Eventually, they stopped attending church and serving in ministry.

However, I believe faith should not be viewed as a transactional exchange with God—where one expects blessings in return for devotion. True faith is believing in God because He is real and sovereign, not because of what He gives us. As it says in the Book of Job, ""The Lord gives and the Lord takes away; blessed be the name of the Lord.""

Our belief in God should be based on His identity as the Creator, not on whether He grants our wishes. Some people treat God like a ""genie in a lamp,"" expecting Him to fulfill their desires, and if He doesn't, they question His existence. But true faith means believing in God for who He is, not what He does for us.

I have explored other religions, but I find it difficult to believe in them. For example, in Buddhism, Siddhartha Gautama never claimed to be a god; he was merely a prince who introduced philosophical teachings. Similarly, Taoism promotes the idea of humans becoming immortals, but I find it hard to accept that one can transform into a deity after death. In Chinese folk beliefs, historical figures such as Guan Yu were later deified, but I find it difficult to believe that humans can become gods.

Islam also raises questions for me. Although I don't know much about it, I’ve heard that Muhammad once claimed he could move a mountain with divine power, but it never happened. On the other hand, Jesus performed many miracles, which makes my faith in Christianity stronger.

After much contemplation and reading the Bible, I find that Christianity presents a true and consistent message. The teachings, moral principles, and historical accounts in the Bible are what convince me that this is the true faith.

15,"1. What do you usually pray for?
a) My main prayer is for my family’s well-being. My biggest wish is for my family to be safe and healthy. I also pray for things to go smoothly—whether it’s work or other aspects of life. My prayers are more focused on practical matters in everyday life.

2. Do you have specific times or settings for prayer?
a) I can pray anytime and anywhere, though I don’t do it often. The most frequent times are in the morning and evening, but sometimes I even skip the morning prayer.

Interviewer: Do you feel that prayer is more effective after certain rituals, such as receiving a pastor’s blessing, attending church, or singing hymns?
Interviewee: I think taking communion might make prayer feel more effective. Hearing the pastor’s words can also make it feel better and more meaningful.

3. Over the years, has your faith changed? Has it deepened, or have you experienced doubts?
a) Sometimes I don’t read the Bible, and I don’t always attend church services. My faith isn’t very devout in terms of outward practices, so I feel like I haven’t made much progress in my spiritual growth.

Interviewer: Have any specific events significantly influenced your understanding of faith?
Interviewee: Not really, everything has been relatively smooth in my life.

4. Optional question: In your opinion, what circumstances or experiences could weaken a devout Christian’s faith or even lead them to doubt or abandon it?
a) I think it would be something that happens within their family. When bad things happen, people might stumble in their faith. Experiencing misfortunes or disasters can shake their belief and cause them to question their faith.

a) My prayers cover a wide range of topics, including life, work, family, and friends and colleagues. I mainly pray for practical matters related to everyday life.

2. What is your usual way of praying? Do you have specific times or settings for prayer? Do you prefer praying at home or in church? Do you pray aloud or silently? What posture do you usually adopt?
a) In church, I usually follow the church’s structure, either standing or sitting. At home, I pray aloud. In church, prayers are typically spoken aloud as well.

Regarding time and setting, I pray in church on weekends, during quarterly or monthly prayer meetings, and I also have a fixed prayer time at home.

Interviewer: Do you think prayer is more effective after certain rituals, such as a pastor’s blessing, taking communion, singing hymns, or reading the Bible together?
Interviewee: Not really. I believe it depends on my internal state—whether I am calm and composed enough to fully engage in communication with God. I think it’s about detaching myself from my surroundings and sincerely connecting with God in the moment. External factors don’t have much influence on me.

3. Over the years, has your belief in prayer and faith in God changed? Have you experienced doubts or a deepening of your faith?
a) I have never had any doubts. Since I first believed in God, my faith has remained strong. Generally, my faith has been growing and deepening over time.

Interviewer: Were there any specific events or experiences that contributed to this deepening?
Interviewee: I think it's largely due to the guidance and support of the faith community. Bible studies and discussions within these groups have helped me gain a deeper understanding of God's word. Through these experiences, I’ve been able to challenge and update many traditional Chinese religious concepts that I previously held.

4. Optional question: In your opinion, what circumstances or experiences could weaken a devout Christian’s faith or even lead them to doubt or abandon it?
a) Personally, I feel that nothing could make me abandon my faith. Although I don't consider myself an extremely devout Christian, I believe that once I truly accepted and understood Jesus, there is no reason for me to give up my faith. Perhaps I haven't faced enough challenges or haven't fully experienced the complexities of the world, which is why my faith remains stable.

Interviewer: What about others? What situations might lead others to doubt or lose their faith?
Interviewee: I think persecution could be a factor. Facing persecution or opposition might cause someone to waver. Another potential reason could be career or professional pressures. Some people might choose to abandon their faith to advance in their careers or due to the demands of the current socio-political climate.",,,,,,

It should all be the same.

I think it has gradually deepened over time.
It’s a gradual process, not due to any specific event.
Being in fellowship with others has helped deepen my understanding and faith.

3. Over the years, has your belief in prayer and faith in God changed? Has it deepened, or have you experienced doubts?

19,"What do you usually pray for?
a) I usually pray about everyday matters, as well as any significant events happening in my life. When something important comes up, I turn to God for help or to seek confidence. My prayers are mostly about practical matters.

2. What is your usual way of praying? Do you pray at home or in church? Do you pray aloud or silently? Do you have a preferred posture that makes your prayers feel more effective?
a) I usually pray at home and do so silently—I don't need to pray aloud. However, I feel that praying while lying down is not as effective, so I usually sit up or kneel on the bed when I pray.

Interviewer: Do you think prayer feels more effective after certain rituals, such as receiving a pastor’s blessing, taking communion, singing hymns, or reading the Bible?
Interviewee: Yes, I think prayers feel more effective after a pastor’s blessing. Also, when praying with others—especially when people hold hands or pray aloud together—I feel that the prayer has more power. Physical contact, such as holding hands, and hearing others pray aloud makes the experience feel more powerful. Praying in church also feels stronger.

3. Over the years, has your belief in prayer and faith in God changed? Has it deepened, or have you experienced doubts or uncertainties?
a) My faith has deepened. When I attended the discipleship training program, I felt that my faith grew during that month. Being in an environment where everyone was a Christian and spending extended time together strengthened my faith.

Another key moment was during my baptism ceremony. The strong sense of ritual made me feel that my faith had deepened even more.

4. Optional question: In your opinion, what circumstances or experiences could weaken a devout Christian’s faith or even lead them to doubt or abandon it?
a) I think if someone earnestly prays for something very important to them but receives no answer, it could shake their faith. If the prayer is for something truly significant and it doesn't come to fruition, it might lead them to question their faith. The lack of a response from God in such a situation could potentially cause doubt.
",,1,,,,
20,"1. What do you usually pray for?
a) Most of my prayers are related to my family. I often pray for my father’s job, my own work, and my service in the church. I also pray for my friends and loved ones. Another fixed part of my prayers is asking God to choose and bring my friends and relatives—who are not yet believers—closer to Him, so they can come to know Him.

2. What is your usual way of praying? Do you usually pray at home, in church, or during fellowship? Do you pray aloud or silently? Do you have specific times or postures for prayer?
a) We have regular family prayers at home. Outside of home, I also pray in church and fellowship groups, but there is no fixed pattern. At home, we usually pray aloud, but in church, when they ask for silent prayer, I pray quietly without speaking out loud. There’s no strict format we follow.

Interviewer: Do you feel that prayer is more effective after certain rituals, such as a pastor’s blessing, taking communion, singing hymns, or reading the Bible?
Interviewee: I think singing hymns helps. We often sing before praying, and I personally feel that it helps me transition into a prayerful state. Singing provides a quieting process, allowing me to calm my mind before I pray. However, I don't necessarily think it makes the prayers more effective; it’s more about helping me focus. Given the distractions of daily life, it's often difficult to quiet myself down for prayer, and hymn-singing helps me achieve that sense of calm.

3. Over the years, has your belief in prayer and faith in God changed? Have you experienced doubts, fluctuations, or growth in your faith?
a) I rarely experience doubt because I believe in the saying, ""Not my will, but Yours be done."" Once I bring my prayers before God, whether they come to fruition or not is up to Him. However, there are moments when my faith feels weak, especially during challenging times.

Interviewer: What kind of situations or experiences might cause these fluctuations in your faith?
Interviewee: Difficulties and hardships. When facing tough situations, occasional doubts do arise.

4. Optional question: In your opinion, what circumstances or experiences could weaken a devout Christian’s faith or even lead them to doubt or abandon it?
a) I think personal hardships can have a significant impact. Many people believe that as long as they have faith in God, their problems will be resolved. However, when things don’t improve or when they can’t see a way forward, they may feel weak. Some people never recover from this weakness, and they start seeking help elsewhere, gradually drifting away from God.",1,,,,,

Interviewer: Do your prayers focus more on practical aspects of daily life, or do you also seek spiritual peace?
Interviewee: It depends on the situation. Sometimes, in certain contexts, when I engage in deep reflection on specific matters, my prayers may involve deeper philosophical or theological contemplation, seeking God's guidance.

2. Do you have specific times or settings for prayer? Do you usually pray at home or in church? Do you prefer praying aloud or silently, and do you have a preferred posture?
a) I usually pray silently, and there’s no fixed location. I pray whenever I feel moved to do so, whether I’m in the office, at home, or in church. In terms of posture, I often pray while kneeling, but it depends on the situation.

Interviewer: Do you feel that prayers are more effective after certain rituals, such as receiving a pastor’s blessing, taking communion, or singing hymns?
Interviewee: Not really. From a theological perspective, God is omnipresent and always available, so prayers can be offered anytime and anywhere. There’s no specific setting that makes prayer more effective.

3. Over the years, has your belief in prayer and faith in God changed? Have you experienced doubts or deepening faith?
a) I haven’t experienced doubt, but I have faced inner struggles. While my faith itself hasn’t wavered, I have had moments of internal conflict, especially when confronting some of the darker aspects of the church. Seeing certain things within the church has sometimes led me to question why God would use certain individuals and to reflect on my own role within the current church environment.

4. Optional question: In your opinion, what circumstances or experiences could weaken a devout Christian’s faith or even lead them to doubt or abandon it?
a) It depends on what we mean by “devout.” If devotion is based solely on an attitude—such as believing that prayers are always answered—then encountering unanswered prayers or unmet expectations might have a significant impact. If someone expects their prayers to always be effective and they aren’t, it could shake their faith.

On the other hand, if devotion is based on a deep, personal experience of faith over time, such individuals are less likely to be significantly affected by challenges. Their faith is built on a more profound foundation that can withstand difficulties.

23,"1. What do you usually pray for?
a) I usually reflect on my day—expressing gratitude for the good things, talking to God about my worries, and confessing any mistakes, asking for His forgiveness. Essentially, I just say whatever comes to mind.

Interviewer: Do you focus more on praying for practical life matters, or do you seek psychological comfort?
Interviewee: I think it’s more about psychological comfort. I believe that practical matters still rely on personal effort. Simply praying without taking action won’t help much. Prayer gives me strength to take action, but ultimately, life requires effort on my part. I entrust things to God, but I still take responsibility for them in daily life.

2. What is your usual way of praying? Do you have specific times or settings for prayer? Do you prefer praying at home or in church, aloud or silently, and do you have a preferred posture?
a) I usually pray silently before bed, kneeling by my bed.

Interviewer: Do you feel that prayer is more effective after certain rituals, such as receiving a pastor's blessing, singing hymns, taking communion, or reading the Bible?
Interviewee: I feel that during prayer meetings, the atmosphere is better. Praying together in a group creates a stronger sense of connection.

3. Over the years, has your belief in prayer and faith in God changed? Have you experienced deepening faith, or have you had doubts or uncertainties?
a) Recently, I’ve been having doubts. I feel that the atmosphere in my fellowship group isn’t what I expected, which makes me question things. It’s not that I doubt my faith in God directly, but since I initially started believing without fully understanding everything, I’m still in an exploration phase. Not having a clear direction or a good environment makes me feel confused and conflicted.

4. Optional question: In your opinion, what circumstances or experiences could weaken a devout Christian’s faith or even lead them to doubt or abandon it?
a) I think it happens when someone is desperately seeking something, and their prayers aren’t answered. However, if someone loses faith just because of that, they may not have been truly devout in the first place. This question is hard to answer.

I knew someone whose entire family was Christian. When their local church was being renovated, his father helped with the construction, but tragically, he fell and passed away. Despite this, my friend never blamed God or let the incident shake his faith. He didn’t question why God allowed it to happen; instead, he remained steadfast.

[Additional Comment:]
The day after his father’s passing, his younger brother had a dream where their father appeared, looking radiant and happy, like a celebrity. In the dream, he told his brother that he was doing well in heaven and even mentioned a specific amount of money the family owed and where to find it. The next day, his brother told their mother, and they found the money exactly where their father had described and paid off the debt.

In a way, this kind of ""miracle"" helped strengthen their faith. Many people only truly accept their need for God when they go through difficult times. When life is too comfortable, people may not feel the same urgency to seek God.",,1,,,,
24,"1. What do you usually pray for?
a) I usually pray about matters of faith, my personal well-being, my health, and my parents' health. I also pray for the well-being of those around me and for my own personal needs.

Interviewer: Do your prayers focus more on practical issues in daily life, or do you also seek a sense of inner peace?
Interviewee: Both. It depends on the situation. Sometimes I pray for practical matters, and other times I seek inner calm and peace.

2. What is your usual way of praying? Do you have specific times or settings for prayer? Do you prefer praying at home, in church, or in fellowship? Do you pray aloud or silently, and do you have a preferred posture?
a) I don’t think any particular posture is required. I pray whenever I feel the need—when I realize I’ve been feeling restless or too caught up in daily life and haven’t connected with my faith for a while. In such cases, I find a quiet place to pray. I can even pray while walking on the street, as long as it’s not too noisy or distracting.

Interviewer: Do you think prayer is more effective after certain rituals, such as receiving a pastor’s blessing, singing hymns, reading the Bible together, or taking communion?
Interviewee: No, I don't think so. I believe prayer is a personal matter. As long as I sincerely open my heart to God, it doesn’t matter who is present or what rituals take place. The most important thing is a genuine connection with God.

3. Over the years, has your belief in prayer and faith in God changed? Have you experienced any doubts, fluctuations, or deepening of your faith?
a) Yes, my faith has evolved over time. Before university, I followed my mother, who is a pastor, and my faith was somewhat shallow—more of a familial belief. But during university, through participation in fellowship groups and exposure to more teachings, I gained a deeper understanding of Christianity. I realized that some of my earlier perceptions were not entirely accurate. My faith has deepened through learning and being part of a Christian community.

4. Optional question: In your opinion, what circumstances or experiences could weaken a devout Christian’s faith or even lead them to doubt or abandon it?
a) A truly devout Christian should have the strength to face many hardships. However, major life tragedies, such as the loss of loved ones, could potentially shake their faith. It would take something deeply painful—perhaps the death of a loved one or another significant life crisis—to challenge their belief.

25,"1. What do you usually pray for?
a) I usually pray about exams and everyday matters of gratitude. If I’ve been very busy and haven’t attended church services for a long time, I also pray about that. My prayers mostly focus on practical aspects of life.

2. What is your usual way of praying? Do you have specific times or settings for prayer? Do you pray at home or in church? Do you pray aloud or silently? Do you have a preferred posture for prayer?
a) I usually pray before going to bed. As for posture, if I'm in a public setting, I won’t pray out loud, but if I'm in a more comfortable environment, I’ll adopt a prayer posture—kneeling or sitting in a prayerful position.

Interviewer: Do you feel that prayer is more effective after certain rituals, such as receiving a pastor’s blessing, singing hymns, reading the Bible together, or taking communion?
Interviewee: Yes, I think so. Normally, I just pray before bed, but when I go to church, there are more rituals involved, which means more opportunities to pray. This makes me feel that the prayer is more effective.

3. Over the years, has your belief in prayer and faith in God changed? Have you experienced fluctuations, doubts, or a deepening of faith?
a) In university, when I got busier, I went for long periods without attending services or praying. I didn’t notice any significant changes in my life during that time, which made me wonder if faith really made a difference.

During a fellowship meeting, an older sister shared that she grew up with faith because of her family but eventually realized that church life involved many complexities, including interpersonal issues. She felt that her faith wasn’t as pure as she had initially thought and started searching for the true purpose of faith. After hearing her story, I started questioning my own beliefs, and I haven't yet found a clear answer.

4. Optional question: In your opinion, what circumstances or experiences could weaken a devout Christian’s faith or even lead them to doubt or abandon it?
a) It could happen when someone pursues a certain path with faith, but the outcome doesn’t align with their expectations. They might start to feel that God hasn’t helped them as they had hoped.

Another possibility is experiencing negative interactions with fellow Christians. If they encounter conflicts or unpleasant situations within the faith community, they might begin to associate their faith with negative experiences. This could lead them to distance themselves from church activities, preferring to pray alone rather than participating in group events.
",1,,1,,,
26,"1. What do you usually pray for?
a) The first part of my prayer is gratitude. Then, I pray for the needs I see around me. Finally, I include intercessory prayers for specific matters.

Interviewer: Do your prayers mainly focus on practical matters in daily life, rather than seeking inner peace?
Interviewee: Yes, they are mostly focused on practical life matters.

2. What is your usual way of praying? Do you have specific times or settings for prayer? Do you prefer praying at home or in church? Do you pray aloud or silently? Do you have a preferred posture for prayer?
a) I pray based on my feelings at the moment. Given my current living conditions and mindset, I usually pray in my dorm room with the curtain drawn. There are no specific requirements for posture.

Interviewer: Do you feel that prayer is more effective after certain rituals, such as group prayers in fellowship, reading the Bible together, singing hymns, receiving a pastor’s blessing, or taking communion?
Interviewee: I tend to prefer personal prayer over group prayer. Although group settings create a good atmosphere, I feel that I am in a better spiritual state when I pray alone.

3. Over the years, has your belief in prayer and faith in God changed? Have you experienced fluctuations, doubts, or growth in your faith?
a) Doubts and fluctuations happen quite often. For me, faith isn’t the most stable aspect of my life.

Interviewer: Have there been specific experiences that caused moments of doubt?
Interviewee: When I go through difficult times, I tend to question my faith. However, I find that every period of doubt ultimately leads to a deeper trust in God.

4. Optional question: In your opinion, what circumstances or experiences could weaken a devout Christian’s faith or even lead them to doubt or abandon it?
a) When they experience situations that contradict what they have been taught in their faith.

Interviewer: Could you give an example?
Interviewee: For example, the Bible teaches that God will not give us more than we can bear. However, in moments of extreme hardship, people might feel that their burdens exceed their capacity. Another example is seeing a strong believer—a person perceived as having unshakable faith—choose to end their life. When such events happen, it can create doubts and conflicts with what we have been taught, leading to potential faith crises.",,,,1,,
27,"1. What do you usually pray for?
a) I usually start by expressing gratitude, then I pray for the needs of those around me—specifically in our fellowship group, where each person is assigned someone to pray for. After that, I pray for my studies, my life, and my family’s well-being and safety. If something significant happens within the group, I will also include it in my prayers.

Interviewer: So your prayers are mostly focused on practical matters in daily life rather than seeking inner peace?
Interviewee: Yes, but I do seek inner peace during prayer meetings.

2. What is your usual way of praying? Do you have specific times or settings for prayer? Do you prefer praying at home or in church? Do you pray aloud or silently? Do you have a preferred posture for prayer?
a) I pray whenever I feel the need—before meals, before sleeping, or when unexpected situations arise. I don’t have a specific time or posture for prayer; it's quite spontaneous. If I’m in a quiet place, I pray silently in my heart, but if circumstances allow, I will pray aloud.

Interviewer: Do you feel that prayer is more effective after certain rituals, such as being blessed by a pastor, singing hymns, reading the Bible together, or taking communion?
Interviewee: I feel that praying together with others makes it more effective. It provides a sense of psychological reassurance and makes me feel that God listens more. There’s a sense of encouragement when we pray in a group.

3. Over the years, has your belief in prayer and faith in God changed? Have you experienced fluctuations, doubts, or growth in your faith?
a) My biggest transformation happened when I attended a Christian summer camp. As a child, I followed my family’s beliefs without much personal understanding. However, during that camp, I felt I made my own choice to believe, rather than just following my family’s faith.

Interviewer: Have you experienced moments of doubt?
Interviewee: Yes, sometimes in difficult moments, I question why I can’t feel God’s presence. Occasionally, I find myself wondering if He’s really there. However, I usually choose to reflect and continue trusting in Him.

4. Optional question: In your opinion, what circumstances or experiences could weaken a devout Christian’s faith or even lead them to doubt or abandon it?
a) I think one reason could be if they feel that the love they receive from the church is insincere or superficial. They may start to see the love as something too broad and impersonal, which could make them feel disconnected.

Another situation is when someone wants to believe, but as they go through deeper teachings or personal reflection, they begin to retreat. When they encounter contradictions between their own thoughts and the teachings of the church, they might start to doubt their faith.

For example, I had a friend who was following a 26-lesson discipleship course with me. I would send him materials, and he would take notes. One day, he suddenly deleted me from his contacts. When I reached out to him, I realized that personal struggles and conflicts between the teachings and his own beliefs made him want to take a step back and reflect alone. This kind of disconnect can lead people to question their faith.
",,,1,1,,
28,"1. What do you usually pray for?
a) I pray for the nation, the church, my family, for sick brothers and sisters, and for the families of those who have not yet come to faith.

Interviewer: So your prayers are mostly focused on practical aspects of life rather than seeking a sense of inner peace, right?
Interviewee: Yes.

2. What is your usual way of praying? Do you have specific times or settings for prayer? Do you pray at home or in church? Do you pray aloud or silently? Do you have a preferred posture for prayer?
a) I have set times for prayer, such as before meals. If I hear about something urgent while on the go, I pray immediately, even while walking. At night, before going to bed, I usually pray—sometimes kneeling, sometimes sitting, and occasionally standing.

Interviewer: Do you feel that kneeling in prayer makes it more effective?
Interviewee: Kneeling makes me feel more confident in my prayers. Sometimes I get lazy and pray sitting or even lying down, but when I pray lying down, I feel a bit guilty, like I’m not showing enough respect to God.

Interviewer: Do you think certain rituals, such as receiving a pastor's blessing, taking communion, singing hymns, or reading the Bible together, make prayer more effective?
Interviewee: Yes, those moments feel very powerful. Praying in such settings gives me a great sense of strength.

3. Over the years, has your belief in prayer and faith in God changed? Have you experienced fluctuations, doubts, or deepening of your faith?
a) My faith has deepened over time. Occasionally, I have had minor doubts, but I quickly see them as temptations and rely on God to remove them.

Interviewer: What kind of events or experiences have caused these minor fluctuations?
Interviewee: Sometimes when I see people suffering from illnesses and waiting for healing, I may have occasional thoughts of doubt.

4. Optional question: In your opinion, what circumstances or experiences could weaken a devout Christian’s faith or even lead them to doubt or abandon it?
a) I believe many times it’s hardship that challenges faith. Personally, I have never lost faith; in fact, through my family's illnesses, I have grown even closer to God and learned to rely on Him more.

However, I have observed that some brothers and sisters struggle with their faith when facing hardships such as illness in their families. These challenges can sometimes make them question their beliefs.",1,,,,,"other people's hardship may weaken their belief, but not mine; mine makes my belief stronger (eventually)"
29,"1. What do you usually pray for?
a) A large part of my prayers focus on my current needs, choices I need to make, and the things I have to deal with. Of course, I also include my daily life, my family, my friends, and my classmates in my prayers.

Interviewer: So your prayers are mostly focused on practical matters in life, praying based on current situations rather than seeking inner peace, correct?
Interviewee: Yes, I believe my life greatly affects my sense of peace. By praying for aspects of my daily life, I can, to some extent, achieve a sense of calm and balance.

2. What is your usual way of praying? Do you have specific times or settings for prayer? Do you prefer praying at home or in church? Do you pray aloud or silently? Do you have a preferred posture for prayer?
a) At school, I mostly pray before going to bed. I usually kneel on my bed and pray silently. When I’m back home, my family gathers together every night to pray aloud while sitting on the floor.

Interviewer: Do you think praying aloud or silently makes a difference? Do you feel praying together with others enhances the experience?
Interviewee: Personally, I think praying aloud or silently makes no difference as long as I am sincerely communicating with God. However, praying together with others does create a better atmosphere, especially when I am able to calm my heart. The group setting fosters a sense of mutual support and encouragement, making it easier to engage in prayer.

Interviewer: Do certain rituals, such as receiving a pastor’s blessing, taking communion, singing hymns, or reading the Bible together, enhance your prayer experience?
Interviewee: I think these rituals do have an impact to some extent. They provide a sense of strength and encouragement, but they are not the decisive factor in my prayer experience. They act more as a support rather than a determining factor.

3. Over the years, has your belief in prayer and faith in God changed? Have you experienced fluctuations, doubts, or growth in your faith?
a) Over the years, I’ve gone through a journey of faith. When I pray for certain things and don’t get the expected results, I sometimes experience moments of doubt. However, as I reflect more on my faith, I realize that prayer is not about asking God for things but about understanding His will, which may not always align with my expectations.

4. Optional question: In your opinion, what circumstances or experiences could weaken a devout Christian’s faith or even lead them to doubt or abandon it?
a) Personally, I haven’t reached a level of absolute devotion, as I do experience moments of weakness. However, I think when my family’s health or well-being is at risk, it impacts me significantly.

Interviewer: What about other people? What circumstances might cause them to question their faith?
Interviewee: I think when someone has been persistently seeking something for a long time, but it continuously deviates from their expectations, it can create doubts and frustrations, making them question their faith.
",1,,,,,
30,"1. What do you usually pray for? What aspects do your prayers cover?
a) I pray for the health of my family and loved ones. I also pray for those affected by natural disasters, such as earthquakes, and for people suffering in the world. I pray for my workplace, for the well-being of my colleagues, and for the safety and health of my family.

Interviewer: So your prayers are mostly focused on practical aspects of life, praying for these specific matters?
Interviewee: Yes, exactly. I also pray for healing from illnesses.

2. What is your usual way of praying? Do you have specific times or settings for prayer? Do you prefer praying at home or in church? Do you pray aloud or silently? Do you have a preferred posture for prayer?
a) I pray in the morning when I wake up and at night before bed. I also pray before each meal—three times a day. Additionally, I pray when driving or taking medication. All of my prayers are silent.

Interviewer: Do you feel that certain rituals make prayer more effective? For example, receiving a pastor’s blessing, taking communion, singing hymns, or reading the Bible together?
Interviewee: No, I don’t feel any particular ritual makes prayer more effective. I have a fixed schedule of praying five times a day—morning, night, and at meals. I also pray when taking medicine. I don't feel that any specific event enhances the effectiveness of my prayers; it's just part of my regular routine.

3. Over the years, has your belief in prayer and faith in God changed? Have you experienced fluctuations, doubts, or growth in your faith?
a) My understanding of faith has deepened over time through reading the Bible, experiencing life events, and participating in church worship. Although I have had occasional doubts, they eventually pass. Overall, my faith has grown stronger.

4. Optional question: In your opinion, what circumstances or experiences could weaken a devout Christian’s faith or even lead them to doubt or abandon it?
a) I think it happens when people do not receive what they pray for—when their desires and requests are not fulfilled. For example, if they pray for health, career success, or other personal wishes, and these things don’t come true, they may begin to question their faith.
",,1,,,,
31,"1. What do you usually pray for?
a) I usually pray for my personal needs. Sometimes, for example, when I’m feeling down, I pray to seek comfort.

Interviewer: So most of your prayers focus on practical matters in life rather than seeking inner peace?
Interviewee: Yes, and mainly when I’m feeling emotionally low.

2. What is your usual way of praying? Do you have specific times or settings for prayer? Do you prefer praying at home or in church? Do you pray aloud or silently? Do you have a preferred posture for prayer?
a) I usually pray at home, mostly at night. Silent prayer is more common for me.

Interviewer: Do you feel that certain rituals make prayer more effective? For example, praying after a pastor’s blessing in church, participating in worship services, singing hymns, or reading the Bible?
Interviewee: I usually feel that praying after a fellowship gathering or Bible reading creates a better experience.

Interviewer: Does it help you get into a better state of mind, or do you feel that prayers are more likely to be answered?
Interviewee: It helps me get into a better state of mind. Without attending fellowship or church, I might not pray as often.

3. Over the years, has your belief in prayer and faith in God changed? Have you experienced fluctuations, doubts, or growth in your faith?
a) I feel like I used to attend church more regularly in college, but my faith still lacks strong confidence.

Interviewer: Were there any specific events that led to changes in your faith?
Interviewee: Not really at the moment. Sometimes, after a long week, I feel tired and less motivated to go to church.

4. Optional question: In your opinion, what circumstances or experiences could weaken a devout Christian’s faith or even lead them to doubt or abandon it?
a) I think if someone is very devout, prays regularly, and attends church frequently, but doesn’t see any improvements in their life, they might start to question their faith.

Interviewer: So, they may feel that despite their dedication, their life hasn't improved as expected?
Interviewee: Yes, they might wonder why their belief hasn't brought about positive changes in their life.
",,1,,,,
32,"1. What do you usually pray for?
a) I usually start my prayers in the morning with a quick prayer, asking for blessings for the day and dedicating it to the Lord. Before praying, I like to sing a hymn to feel the presence of the Holy Spirit, which fills me with hope for the new day.

2. Do you have a specific way or time for praying? Do you prefer praying at home or in church? Do you pray aloud or silently? Do you find a specific posture more effective?
a) I usually pray in my room, and I prefer praying aloud. If I'm really tired, I might pray silently, but I prefer to speak my prayers out loud when possible.

Interviewer: Do you feel that certain rituals make your prayers more effective, or help you enter a more spiritual state? For example, praying after reading the Bible, singing hymns, receiving a pastor’s blessing, or taking communion?
Interviewee: I think all of these can help. What matters most is the act of praying itself. If you pray with sincerity, it doesn’t matter where you are, because the Holy Spirit is within you. Praying at home or at church feels similar, but in church, the atmosphere created by everyone praying together makes it feel even more special.

3. Over the years, has your belief in prayer and faith in God changed? Have you experienced fluctuations or deepened your faith?
a) I think it depends on life circumstances. Sometimes when work gets busy, I might forget to pray, and that makes me feel distant from God. But establishing habits like attending church every Sunday and praying every morning helps me stay connected to Him.

I haven’t experienced major fluctuations because I’ve believed in God since childhood. However, I do notice that when life is going smoothly, I may become complacent and pray less. But when I encounter difficulties at work or in life, I naturally turn to God more frequently for help.

4. Optional question: In your opinion, what circumstances or experiences could weaken a devout Christian’s faith or even cause them to lose it?
a) I think truly devout Christians often grow stronger in faith during difficult times. Many people wonder, “Why does God let me go through this?” But later, they realize that going through hardships gives them a stronger testimony when sharing their faith.

However, one thing that can shake someone's faith is conflict within the church community. The church is like a big family, but sometimes there are misunderstandings, gossip, or conflicts. If these issues escalate and become harmful, it might discourage believers and make them question their involvement in the church.

Still, I believe that everything God allows us to go through has a purpose. If we seek to learn from these experiences, they can ultimately strengthen our faith.
",,,1,,,
33,"1. What do you usually pray for?
a) I usually pray for things like having a smooth day or if I've encountered any challenges recently, I will bring them up in my prayers.

Interviewer: So you mostly pray for practical life matters rather than seeking a sense of inner peace, right?
Interviewee: Yes, that's right.

2. What is your usual way of praying? Do you have a specific time or place, such as at home or in church? Do you pray aloud or silently? Do you find any specific posture more effective?
a) Most of the time, I pray during my daily life. Since I'm at school, I usually pray there. There is no specific posture; it's more like talking to God in my heart.

Interviewer: Do you feel that certain rituals, such as receiving a pastor's blessing, taking communion, singing hymns, or reading the Bible together, make your prayers more effective?
Interviewee: Yes, in those settings, I do feel more immersed.

Interviewer: Do you feel that being in such a state helps you get into the right mindset, or do you think your prayers are more likely to be answered?
Interviewee: Yes, I do feel that it helps me get into the right mindset and makes my prayers feel more sincere.

3. Over the years, has your faith in prayer and God changed? Have you experienced doubts, fluctuations, or strengthened faith?
a) In recent years, I have had moments of doubt and uncertainty. In the past, when things didn’t go according to my expectations, I questioned whether God was truly helping me. But in the last two years, my faith has become much stronger.

Interviewer: What kind of experiences led to these fluctuations or changes in your faith?
Interviewee: In the past, my thoughts were not very mature, and when I felt that God wasn’t answering my prayers in the way I wanted, I would doubt my faith. However, recently, being around people who share the same beliefs and learning more about God's words has helped me realize that God has always been with me, which has strengthened my faith.

4. Optional question: For a devout Christian, what kind of situations or experiences might weaken their faith in God or even cause them to lose their faith?
a) I think it depends on the individual. Some people may experience a weakening of faith if they rarely engage in conversations with God.

Interviewer: Can you think of a situation where someone who was once very committed might lose faith?
Interviewee: If someone is deeply committed and regularly participates in worship, they are unlikely to experience a major loss of faith. However, if they go through long periods without prayer or spiritual connection, their faith may gradually fade.

Interviewer: So you believe that as long as a person is consistent in their faith, it should naturally deepen over time?
Interviewee: Yes, I think so.
",,,,,,
34,"1. What do you usually pray for?
a) My prayers usually include my family's health, any major upcoming events like exams, and other unexpected matters. Besides that, I also pray for daily needs. If my friends ask me to pray for them, I include their specific needs as well. Recently, my prayers have also been about my daily studies.

Interviewer: So your prayers mostly focus on practical life matters rather than seeking inner peace, right?
Interviewee: Yes, seeking inner peace happens less frequently unless there is an important event coming up, such as a presentation the next day. Otherwise, I focus more on specific matters rather than general feelings.

2. What is your usual way of praying? Do you have a specific time or place? Do you pray at home or in church? Do you pray silently or aloud? What posture do you find most effective?
a) I have some fixed routines, like praying silently before meals by closing my eyes. Before going to bed, I kneel by my bed. When I’m studying or preparing assignments, I sit at my desk and close my eyes for a silent prayer. Silent prayer is more common for me. Occasionally, I pray aloud during special prayer meetings at church or when praying with my parents, where we pray together aloud, either standing or kneeling.

Interviewer: Do you feel that certain rituals, such as singing hymns, receiving a pastor’s blessing, taking communion, or group prayers, make your prayers more effective?
Interviewee: Normally, I don't focus on whether a prayer is more ""effective,"" but in cases where I feel guilty—like wasting a whole day or doing something I know I shouldn’t have—then I might feel the need to kneel and pray to show repentance. In such moments, I feel it’s necessary to take it seriously.

3. Over the years, has your faith in prayer and God changed? Have you experienced doubts or strengthened beliefs?
a) My faith has changed over time. When I was younger, my belief was mainly influenced by my parents, as they were very devout. But during high school, I began to develop a more personal relationship with God. There hasn't been a drastic change in prayer habits, but I have become more intentional about my faith journey.

Interviewer: Was there any specific experience in high school that led to a leap in your faith?
Interviewee: Yes, I had an experience that made me realize the reality of spiritual matters. A relative of mine, who was said to be possessed by an evil spirit, came to our house. I used to hear about such things, but I had never seen it firsthand. That evening, my parents were praying outside, and I sensed something unusual happening. I started praying in my room, and over the next couple of days, I felt a tangible impact on my life. From then on, I began taking my faith more seriously and engaging more actively in church activities.

4. Optional question: For a devout Christian, what kind of situations might weaken their faith or even lead them to lose it?
a) Personally, I used to think nothing could make me abandon my faith, but during my senior year of university, I experienced a crisis of faith. It wasn’t about doubting God’s existence, but rather a struggle with surrendering control to Him. For example, I liked someone and wasn’t sure if pursuing that relationship was God’s will. I feared that if I prayed sincerely, God might lead me away from it. This led me to avoid prayer altogether for a while.

Interviewer: So you think a major struggle for Christians is surrendering control to God?
Interviewee: Yes, especially when facing things they don’t want to let go of. When life demands sacrifices, it can create tension in faith, leading people to avoid facing God’s will directly.
",1,,,,,
35,"1. What do you usually pray for?
a) My prayers are often focused on my family’s safety and health. I also pray to become more like Christ, to change my personality and bad habits.

Interviewer: Do you pray more for practical life matters, or do you seek inner peace through prayer?
Interviewee: I pray for both. For example, I pray for my family's safety, but I also seek inner peace. In the morning, I pray for God's presence throughout the day and for self-reflection, asking for help in my thoughts and actions. Recently, I’ve been praying about how I can participate in church service since I haven't been involved much lately. I've been attending online services from Luoyuan Church, but I feel a lack of community. When I was in the U.S., I attended Bible study groups and women's fellowships, which I found beneficial. However, I haven't found similar opportunities here.

2. What is your usual way of praying? Do you have specific times or places, such as at home or in church? Do you pray aloud or silently, and do you find certain postures more effective?
a) I don’t think a specific posture is necessary. Prayer can be done anytime and anywhere. Typically, I pray in the morning, before meals, and at night. If something troubling happens during the day, I pray immediately. If I feel unwell, I pray right away.

Interviewer: Do you think certain rituals make prayer more effective, such as receiving a pastor’s blessing, singing hymns, or taking communion?
Interviewee: I don't usually think about it that way, but I remember when my daughter was sick, a pastor came to our home to pray for her. That prayer brought me a deep sense of relief, and I cried. After that, I decided to get baptized at Luoyuan Church. When I was in the U.S., the fellowship groups would often pray for my daughter, and those prayers also touched me deeply, often bringing me to tears.

3. Over the years, has your faith in prayer and God changed? Have you experienced doubts or strengthened beliefs?
a) There have been times when my faith wavered, and moments of doubt crossed my mind. However, when I was in the U.S. and actively involved in fellowship, my faith felt stronger. Now that I’m back and not part of a group, my faith feels more routine.

Interviewer: Have life experiences influenced your faith?
Interviewee: Yes, experiencing hardships, such as my daughter's illness, has deepened my faith. Difficulties often bring people closer to God. In times of suffering, we seek Him more, casting our burdens onto Him and finding peace. On the other hand, when life is smooth, people tend to forget God.

4. Optional question: For a devout Christian, what kind of situations or experiences might weaken their faith or lead to doubt?
a) I think if a person becomes too comfortable and indulges in worldly pleasures, they may gradually drift away from God. Being constantly busy with entertainment and socializing can create distance from faith. On the other hand, experiencing extreme hardships—like Job in the Bible—could also test a person’s faith. I’m not sure if I would have the same strength as Job to stay faithful under such trials.

Interviewer: Would you say a smooth life could lead people to stray from God?
Interviewee: Yes, I believe when life is going well, with career success and a comfortable life, people might not feel the need to rely on God as much.",,,,,,
36,"1. What do you usually pray about?
a) My prayers are more like conversations with God. I talk about things that happened to me during the day. I don’t often pray asking God to fulfill specific requests; instead, I focus more on sharing—sharing experiences related to my faith and daily life.

Interviewer: So your prayers are more about practical aspects of life rather than seeking inner peace?
Interviewee: Yes, and sometimes when I feel emotionally down, I pray for comfort.

2. How do you usually pray? Do you have specific times or places, such as at home or in church? Do you pray aloud or silently, and do you find certain postures more effective?
a) I usually pray at night before bed. I prefer kneeling because it feels more traditional, but if I’m really tired, I might just lie down and pray.

Interviewer: Do you feel that certain rituals, like receiving a pastor’s blessing, singing hymns together, or reading the Bible before prayer, enhance its effectiveness?
Interviewee: Not really. Singing with others provides emotional support, but I don’t think rituals themselves make my prayers more effective.

3. Over the years, has your faith in prayer and God changed? Have you experienced doubts or strengthened beliefs?
a) Yes, my faith has fluctuated. Over the past one or two years, I’ve read books with a skeptical or postmodern perspective, which made me question whether anything can be absolutely trusted.

b) I’ve also had conversations with others who struggle with pain and suffering, which made me wonder why their problems remain unresolved despite their faith.

c) However, recently, I feel more stable in my faith. I’ve realized that faith is something beyond absolute proof. Even though I have doubts, I still choose to believe. Listening to others and reading has made me reflect, and I understand that doubts don’t necessarily mean abandoning faith but rather seeking answers within it.

4. What kinds of experiences or circumstances might weaken a devout Christian's faith or cause them to doubt and lose belief?
a) Encountering problems they cannot solve on their own may lead to doubt, especially when they feel powerless. If they isolate themselves from church and fellowship, their faith may gradually cool down.

b) Disappointment in the church community can also be a factor. Some might feel that church teachings are inspiring, but the actions of church members do not align with those teachings. This could lead them to question why, if believers are ""new creations"" in Christ, the church still has so many imperfections and problems.",1,,1,,,
37,"1. What do you usually pray about?
Let me think… Usually, I pray for a smooth day and for personal matters that I want to communicate to God. I think that’s it.

Interviewer: So, your prayers are mostly about practical, everyday life issues?
Interviewee: Yes, they are mostly about daily matters.

2. How do you usually pray? Do you have specific times or places, such as at home or in church? Do you pray aloud or silently, and do you feel that certain postures make your prayers more effective?
I’m not very strict about it; I’m not as traditional as some people. I can pray anywhere, both aloud and silently, whether at home or in church.

Interviewer: Do you think kneeling makes prayers more effective?
Interviewee: If I can, I feel kneeling does help a bit, but in general, as long as you have the right heart, it's effective.

3. Do you think certain rituals, such as receiving a pastor’s blessing, singing hymns together, or reading the Bible beforehand, make prayers more effective?
I think all of those are nice, but the most important thing is to prepare your heart before praying. There’s no need for elaborate rituals; as long as you quiet your heart and set aside time, it’s effective.

4. Over the years, has your faith in prayer and God changed? Have you experienced any deepening of faith or any doubts?
In the past, I didn’t like to pray much because I felt I didn’t have time for it. But there has been a shift, as I realized that I need an outlet to express myself. Instead of sharing too much with others, I find that prayer provides a way to talk about things in my heart.

5. Lastly, what kind of events or circumstances might weaken a devout Christian's faith, or even lead them to lose their belief?
I think major life difficulties—such as facing serious illnesses within the family or experiencing personal hardships—could shake someone’s faith. When facing challenges that are beyond one’s personal or family’s capacity to handle, doubts might arise. Not everyone can withstand such tests.
",1,,,,,
38,"1. What do you usually pray about?
My personal matters, family concerns—like entrusting my family to God—and my oral exams.

Interviewer: So, your prayers are mainly about practical aspects of life?
Interviewee: Yes, and also about my spiritual growth.

2. How do you usually pray? Do you have specific times or places, such as at home or in church? Do you pray aloud or silently, and do you feel certain postures make your prayers more effective?
I personally prefer to pray at home, in private with the door closed. If I feel particularly moved, I might play some audio and pray in the dark. I find that helps me go deeper and feel more emotional connection. When I'm tired or feeling worn out, I find I need to return to God for rest.

Interviewer: So, do you feel kneeling is better than lying down when you pray at home?
Interviewee: I usually sit. I don’t think a specific posture is required because I see it as a personal communication with God rather than focusing on formality.

3. Do you think certain rituals, such as receiving a pastor’s blessing, singing hymns together, or reading the Bible beforehand, make prayers more effective?
At the moment, it might feel good to do those things, but I personally think the best moments are when I pray alone before bed. That’s when I feel it’s just between me and God, and I find it more meaningful and effective.

4. Over the years, has your faith in prayer and God changed? Have you experienced any deepening of faith or any doubts?
Yes, at the beginning, I had doubts about God. I still do sometimes, but those doubts lead me to think more deeply about Him. My faith has grown over time, especially through experiences that have shown me I can trust Him more. I used to be afraid of the future, but now I’ve learned to entrust it to Him, which has eased my fears.

Interviewer: So after moments of doubt, do you feel your faith has deepened?
Interviewee: Yes, there are ups and downs. Sometimes I feel distant from my faith, but when I realize I need to hold onto something, I feel drawn back to God. That’s why I make time at night to reconnect with Him.

Interviewer: What kind of situations make you feel distant or doubtful?
Interviewee: When my life feels too mundane. I find it hard to stay engaged in a routine lifestyle, and when I drift, I feel like God is far away.

5. Lastly, what kind of events or circumstances might weaken a devout Christian's faith, or even lead them to lose their belief?
I think it’s when something they value the most is challenged. For example, if they have unwavering faith initially, but then experience something they deeply desire not being fulfilled, their faith might be shaken. If someone lacks a firm foundation in God, their faith can waver when life doesn't go as expected. They might struggle to understand why God allows certain challenges, which can create distance between them and their faith.

Interviewer: So you mean when someone faces suffering beyond what they can handle, it could lead to doubt?
Interviewee: Yes, exactly.",1,1,,,,
39,"1. What do you usually pray about?
I usually pray for not getting sick and for issues related to my studies.

Interviewer: So, your prayers are mainly about practical aspects of life?
Interviewee: Yes.

2. How do you usually pray? Do you have specific times or places, such as at home or in church? Do you pray aloud or silently, and do you feel certain postures make your prayers more effective?
I usually prefer praying before bedtime when it’s quieter. Since I live in a dormitory, praying out loud would seem strange to my roommates, as they don't have faith. I usually pray silently while lying on my bed. Sometimes, I lie down with my hands clasped, and other times, I curl up or kneel to pray.

Interviewer: Do you feel that kneeling makes prayer more effective?
Interviewee: Yes, it feels more like praying in church or at home, giving a sense of familiarity and reverence.

3. Do you think certain rituals, such as receiving a pastor’s blessing, singing hymns together, or reading the Bible beforehand, make prayers more effective?
Yes, I feel that praying in a group is better than praying alone. When I pray with my mother at home, it feels like having a leader, which makes it more powerful and motivating.

4. Over the years, has your faith in prayer and God changed? Have you experienced any deepening of faith or any doubts?
I have rarely experienced doubts or fluctuations because I have been praying since childhood. My mother is a pastor, and she prays for us every day at home. Even when we video call, she tells me she is praying for me daily. My grandmother, who has passed away, used to hold my hand and pray for me whenever we met, even though we didn’t live together.

Interviewer: Has there been a specific event that deepened your faith?
Interviewee: The mission training camp was a significant experience that deepened my faith. It gave me a more profound understanding of God. Before that, I only knew that Jesus was good because my mom told me so, and I grew up in church. However, I never systematically studied why we believe in Jesus and why faith is important.

5. Lastly, what kind of events or circumstances might weaken a devout Christian's faith, or even lead them to lose their belief?
I think it could be something that happens to people around them—something deeply personal that makes them feel like Jesus didn’t truly help them. Even if they keep praying, they might still experience things they really didn’t want to happen.",,1,,,,
40,"1. What do you usually pray about?
I usually pray about my own worries and anxieties, things that trouble me the most.

Interviewer: So, your prayers are mainly about practical aspects of life?
Interviewee: Yes, mostly about my personal anxieties and mental state, like how I'm feeling right now.

2. How do you usually pray? Do you have specific times or places, such as at home or in church? Do you pray aloud or silently, and do you feel certain postures make your prayers more effective?
In university, each group has fellowship meetings, and we have regular gatherings where we read the Bible and pray together. Everyone prays and supports each other in intercession, so that’s a set time.

Other than that, I usually pray by myself, mostly at night. Nighttime is when I feel most open, and I randomly decide when to pray based on my mood.

Interviewer: Do you feel that kneeling makes prayer more effective?
Interviewee: Kneeling might give a better feeling, yes.

Interviewer: Do you think certain rituals, like receiving a pastor’s blessing or singing hymns before praying, make prayer more effective?
Interviewee: I think praying alone allows me to quiet my heart more effectively. It helps me reflect more deeply, express myself more openly, and be more sincere in my prayers.

3. Over the years, has your faith in prayer and God changed? Have you experienced any deepening of faith or any doubts?
Yes, this happens quite frequently. I attend worship services regularly, but since I often pray about my anxiety issues, I sometimes feel distant from God. There are times when I avoid going to church and instead retreat into my own anxious thoughts.

Interviewer: So, your emotional state affects your faith?
Interviewee: Yes, exactly. I sometimes feel like there are two conflicting voices inside me—one telling me to go to church, and another making me dwell on my anxieties and stay away.

4. Lastly, what kind of events or circumstances might weaken a devout Christian's faith, or even lead them to lose their belief?
I think it could be when people take their faith too seriously and overanalyze it. Sometimes, when I hear others discuss faith in overly deep or complex ways, I feel like it goes beyond the core beliefs and makes me start questioning things.

Interviewer: So, overthinking faith can sometimes lead to doubts?
Interviewee: Yes, especially when people share ideas that seem to deviate from mainstream beliefs—it makes me wonder if I'm on the right path.
",,,,1,,
41,"1. What do you usually pray about?
My prayers usually include three aspects:

Prayers for my family members.
Prayers for myself, such as my studies or other personal needs.
Prayers of intercession for others.
Interviewer: So your prayers are mostly focused on practical, everyday matters?
Interviewee: Yes.

2. How do you usually pray? Do you have specific times or places, such as at home or in church? Do you pray aloud or silently, and do you feel certain postures make your prayers more effective?
It depends on where I am.

At home, I usually pray silently while either lying on my bed or kneeling beside it.
In church or small fellowship groups, I pray aloud, also kneeling.
Interviewer: Do you feel that certain rituals make prayer more effective? For example, after a pastor's blessing, singing hymns, or reading the Bible together?
Interviewee: I think hymns with some background music as guidance help me get into the state of prayer better.

3. Over the years, has your faith in prayer and God changed? Have you experienced any deepening of faith or any doubts?
It has been a process of becoming increasingly firm in my faith.
There have been many moments where I felt touched or encountered God, leading to significant spiritual breakthroughs.

Interviewer: Can you recall any specific experiences where you felt touched?
Interviewee: Yes, for example, when I was in eighth grade, I was struggling with playing the electric guitar. During a mission trip, I needed to play, but I felt inadequate and blamed myself. That night, there was a long prayer meeting, and I really felt immersed in the atmosphere. It was at that moment I felt deeply touched.

4. Lastly, what kind of events or circumstances might weaken a devout Christian's faith, or even lead them to lose their belief?
I think suffering is a major challenge.

For beginners or those whose faith is not strong enough, they might expect that believing in God will bring blessings and protection, similar to the way people think of Buddhism. But when they encounter difficulties that don't align with their expectations, their faith might weaken.

Another reason could be when influential believers around them stumble.

Interviewer: By ""stumble,"" do you mean setting a bad example?
Interviewee: Yes, it could be setting a bad example or encountering significant difficulties that make them fall away.

Interviewer: So you mean primarily when they act contrary to their faith?
Interviewee: Yes, that's what I mean.",1,,1,,,
42,"1. What do you usually pray about?
My prayers usually include:

Prayers before meals and before sleeping.
Prayers for my weaknesses.
Prayers for my family’s health and for their salvation.
Prayers for my fellowship, interceding for my brothers and sisters in Christ.
Interviewer: So your prayers mostly focus on practical life matters?
Interviewee: Yes.

2. How do you usually pray? Do you have specific times or places, such as at home or in church? Do you pray aloud or silently? And do you feel certain postures make your prayers more effective?
I believe prayer can happen anytime and anywhere, but I usually kneel on my bed or pray silently when I experience something meaningful.

Interviewer: Do you think certain rituals make prayer more effective? For example, after a pastor’s blessing, singing hymns together, reading the Bible, or taking communion?
Interviewee: I think these rituals can make me feel more touched. When I am led in prayer through these, I feel it’s very meaningful. However, rituals themselves are not as important; it's more about whether I feel moved inside.

3. Over the years, has your faith in prayer and God changed? Have you experienced any deepening of faith or any doubts?
Yes, definitely. At first, my faith was inherited from my parents. But gradually, it became my own faith, and I started seeking God more personally.
In this process, I learned to pray and read the Bible more.

Interviewer: So what experiences or events led to this change?
Interviewee: I realized through various experiences that relying on myself was not enough, and I had to depend on God more and believe in Him more deeply.

4. Lastly, what kind of events or circumstances might weaken a devout Christian's faith, or even lead them to lose their belief?
It depends on the person. Some people experience major trauma and end up believing even more, while others may feel that things didn't go their way and start doubting.

If it were me, my first reaction might be to question why God allowed this to happen to me, and I might initially complain. But eventually, I would come to think that everything happens according to God's plan. Everyone reacts differently to challenges.",1,,,,,"""it it were me, I might initially complain but eventually come to think that everything happens according to God's plan"""
43,"1. What do you usually pray about?
My prayers focus primarily on gratitude. As a believer, I feel that we live under God's grace, so gratitude is essential.
I also reflect on myself—how far I am from God's will—and ask God to guide me, as I often fall into weakness. I pray for God's guidance to help me live according to His will, acknowledging that I cannot do it alone.

2. How do you usually pray? Do you have specific times, places, or postures?
I pray regularly during meals, in the morning, and before bed. Throughout the day, I pray whenever I feel the need, even while walking or encountering difficulties.

Posture: I usually sit while praying because it allows me to relax and extend my prayers. While I have tried kneeling, I find it physically tiring and difficult to sustain. I kneel only during urgent situations.
3. Do you think certain rituals enhance your prayers?
I feel particularly moved during Holy Communion.
Additionally, my small group prayer meetings are very effective. In a small, trusted group of five to six sisters, I can open up and share my burdens freely, which I find difficult in a larger church setting.

4. Has your faith in prayer and God changed over the years? Have you experienced doubts or deepening of faith?
My faith has deepened, but it has been a spiral journey rather than a straight line of progress.
There have been times of doubt and low points, especially during challenges such as health issues or being unable to be with my family when they needed me most.

Difficult moments: Sometimes I questioned why my prayers weren’t answered, especially when I faced hardships like health issues or family emergencies.
Growth moments: Over time, I've realized that God’s plans are higher than my own, and even when I don’t understand them immediately, I later see His love and presence guiding me.
5. In your opinion, what could weaken or even cause a devoted Christian to lose faith?
Unanswered prayers: When prayers seem unanswered, people may struggle with doubt.
Environmental influences: External events, such as wars or conflicts (e.g., the Israel-Hamas conflict), may challenge one’s understanding of God's plan.
Observing other Christians: Seeing believers who fail to live according to their faith can also cause doubt, making it difficult to stay focused on God.",,1,1,1,,
44,"1) What do you usually pray about?
What do I usually pray about? Let me think.
Generally, it’s about gratitude—being thankful to God for everything that happens around me, thankful for my peace, and thankful for meeting others.
I also pray for the needs of the brothers and sisters I see around me, and entrust these matters to God.
These things take up the majority of my prayers.
A smaller portion of my prayers may include things like glory and praise, but that part is relatively minor.
So, the majority of my prayers are about practical matters in life.
Yes, intercessory prayer takes up a large part.

2) How do you usually pray?
For example, do you have specific times and settings?
Do you pray at home or in church?
Do you pray aloud or silently?
And what posture do you feel is most effective for prayer?

Oh, my way of praying isn’t very fixed.
For example, before bed, if I’m too tired, I might not kneel to pray.
Sometimes, if I have a need, I might just pray while walking,
praying on the go without closing my eyes or anything like that.

If I feel that praying aloud won’t disturb others or cause much disruption,
then I will pray out loud.
But if I think it might affect those around me,
I will pray silently in my heart.

Sometimes, when I can’t pray verbally or silently,
I try writing down what I want to say—
writing my prayers in a notebook.

So, overall, my prayer habits are quite casual—
praying anytime and anywhere in various forms.

3) Over the years, has your faith in prayer and God changed?
Have you experienced any deepening of faith or any doubts?

Yes, it has changed.
Before going to university, I felt like my faith was mostly based on the knowledge I received from my parents and teachers.
I simply accepted it without much questioning.

It was like having a bookshelf in my mind,
where I stored all the knowledge I received like books,
but I never really took them down to examine or think deeply about them.

After going to university,
I started to have my own doubts about the knowledge I had received.
And when I experienced things firsthand,
I came to realize more deeply that God is truly real and living.
He is real, yes.

Can you share a specific experience that made you feel touched in this way?

For example, the night before last—haha, so recent.
Actually, tonight as well, but I think the night before last was more significant.

Because of some differences in opinion with a sister from church—
a close sister—we had some disagreements.
She was quite upset.
During our conversation,
I felt misunderstood and deeply disappointed.
It seemed like our relationship had caused me some hurt.

On the subway ride to my small group gathering,
I started crying and cried all the way there.

I had planned to go to the small group to retrieve a book
I thought I had left behind during an overnight stay.
But when I arrived, I found that the book wasn’t there.
At that moment, I felt even more down.

I turned off the lights,
sat in front of the piano,
and played some worship music I had listened to before.
I cried my heart out, saying,
“Lord, I came here today; please comfort me.”

Unexpectedly, no one knew I was at the small group.
Then, I remembered that a mentor had mentioned in the group chat
that they were planning to drop something off at the small group.

Earlier, I had wanted to reach out to a friend online,
but unexpectedly, that night,
the mentor happened to come in person,
and we were able to talk face-to-face.

I felt that this was such a wonderful arrangement, truly God's plan.

That mentor was someone else, not the sister you had a disagreement with, right?
Yes, exactly.
The mentor and the sister also have a good relationship.
Everyone knows each other well.

4) Lastly, what kind of events or circumstances might weaken a devout Christian's faith, or even lead them to lose their belief?

A devout Christian? Hmm...
I haven’t personally experienced such situations,
so it’s a bit difficult for me to imagine.

But among my friends—those who may not have a very close relationship with God—
some have sincerely prayed for things they wanted to accomplish,
but when those things didn’t happen as they wished,
they felt like God had failed them,
and they abandoned their faith.

Others may have experienced hurt
from fellow brothers and sisters in the church.
Because of these negative experiences,
they became disappointed and discouraged with the church community
and eventually abandoned their faith and left the church.

In summary, I think it’s mainly due to
a misunderstanding of God,
becoming discouraged in their relationship with Him,
or feeling hurt by fellow believers,
which ultimately leads to them giving up their faith.
",,1,1,,,
45,"1) What do you usually pray about?
What do I usually pray about? Is it about specific things?
Yes, for example, do you mostly pray for practical matters in daily life, or do you pray more to seek inner peace?
Both. In fact, I've been preparing for my graduate exams for the past six months, so I haven't had much time to participate in offline gatherings.
As a result, my prayers have mostly been personal devotion or reflection.
My prayer content generally revolves around my daily life,
but over the past six months, I’ve been praying more when I feel anxious or troubled—
seeking to calm myself down or find inner peace.

2) How do you usually pray?
For example, do you have specific times or settings, such as at home or in church?
Do you pray aloud, or do you prefer silent prayer?
Do you think a certain posture helps your prayers be more effective?

I usually pray before meals with a short prayer and before going to bed at night.
I don't have a particular formal way of praying.
I used to kneel, but since it's inconvenient in the dormitory,
I usually just close my eyes and pray before sleeping.

Do you feel that certain rituals make prayers more effective?
For example, after a pastor’s blessing, taking Holy Communion in church,
or singing hymns and reading the Bible together?

When there's a pastor present, yes.
A pastor’s prayers resonate more with me and touch me deeply.
For instance, this morning, a pastor came to visit my home because I’ve been unwell recently.
My mom invited him over, and we prayed together.
I felt that the pastor’s prayer had a much greater impact on me.

3) Over the years, has your faith in prayer and God changed?
Have you experienced doubts or a deepening of your faith?

A lot, actually.
I personally believe that faith is something that constantly evolves.
I often have doubts,
but I believe that faith can withstand our doubts and questioning.
Every time I experience doubts,
it’s actually an opportunity for me to further transform and grow in faith.

One significant turning point was during my second and third years of high school.
That period marked a transition from a faith inherited from my family
to a more personal and individual belief.

Was there any specific event or experience that led to this transformation?

Yes, at that time, some issues arose in my family,
and I tried to avoid dealing with them.
However, brothers and sisters from the church reached out to me
and spent a lot of time communicating with me.
Eventually, I started facing my family relationships head-on
and reevaluating the place of God in my life.

Before that, my understanding of faith
was entirely based on what my family had passed down to me,
without any personal experience.
But that period planted a small seed in me,
and gradually, through attending more gatherings and learning step by step,
I came to know God on a deeper, personal level.

4) Lastly, what kind of events or circumstances might weaken a devout Christian's faith, or even lead them to lose their belief?

Could you repeat the question?

Sure.
For a devout Christian, what kind of events, circumstances,
or personal experiences might weaken their faith in God,
or even lead them to lose it?

I can talk about what happened at my school.
Over the past year, the authorities in Fuzhou have been cracking down on churches extensively.
At my school, our entire fellowship group was exposed,
and all the core members were identified.

I was summoned to the college secretary's office for questioning,
and they interrogated me for four hours.
Another core team member, because he is a party member,
was questioned for seven hours.

The pressure was real.
They had an entire system of questioning,
trying to extract information and intimidate us.
Afterward, I was genuinely afraid.

It’s hard to say that I remained completely strong in my faith.
I felt I wasn’t strong enough.
After the interrogation, I was worried—
not only for our fellowship but also for my future,
thinking about whether this would affect my studies or future job prospects.

The college authorities used various threats,
saying my academic records might be affected,
that my graduation might be at risk,
and they used many different tactics to intimidate me.

I was scared for a while,
thinking about whether all this would impact my future.
But later, I reached out to some older brothers and sisters in faith,
who reassured me and reminded me
that what we were doing had no legal or moral fault.

The authorities were just afraid of us—
afraid of the influence and strength of our faith,
which is why they were trying to suppress us.

I went through a period of struggle in my faith after that,
wondering why this was happening
and why I had to face such opposition.

Ultimately, I realized that this is part of my faith journey.
This is my belief, and I should hold onto it firmly.

So, facing challenges from society,
or even from the government,
can shake one’s faith.
But whether or not it ultimately leads to a loss of faith
depends on how well one truly understands their faith in God.
",,,,,1,
46,"1) What do you usually pray about?
What do I usually pray about? That might depend on my age.
When I was younger, I used to pray about more childish things,
like asking for the boys I liked to like me back—
of course, it never really worked.
As I got older, my prayers became more focused on family and friends,
as well as myself.
For example, now I pray more for urgent wishes and desires.

2) How do you usually pray?
For example, do you have specific times or settings?
Do you pray at home or in church?
Do you pray aloud or silently?
Do you have a preferred prayer posture,
and do you feel prayer is more effective after certain rituals,
such as taking communion, receiving a pastor's blessing, or singing hymns?

I think I do a bit of everything.
Personally, I'm not very consistent with morning prayers,
I’m not doing that well in that aspect.
But at night, I usually manage to pray consistently.

When I pray at night, I tend to kneel down.
However, since I'm currently at school,
it feels a bit awkward,
so I usually just lie on my stomach in bed and pray that way.

At home, every Saturday we have family prayer time with my parents.
On important holidays like Christmas or Easter, we go to church.
But honestly, I don’t go to church that often,
partly because there are no Catholic churches in Ruian,
which is quite awkward for me.
Instead, I have many Protestant friends there.
Every Friday evening, we gather for a meal.
In high school, I was too busy to go often,
but I still made it a few times a month,
and we would have group prayers during those gatherings.

3) Over the years, has your faith in prayer and God changed?
Have you experienced any deepening of faith or doubts?

My faith has deepened,
and I don’t think I've ever really doubted it.

I think when I was younger,
I didn't fully understand faith.
We had fellowship every Friday,
and 90% of the people there were Protestants,
but we all got along well
since our beliefs were pretty similar.

When I was very young,
most of my time at fellowship—probably around 60%—
was spent playing with other kids in another room,
while the adults had deeper discussions.

So, I think a lot of it was just being immersed in that environment.
As I grew older, my faith deepened.

So, was it more about gradually understanding faith better as you grew up,
or were there specific experiences, like reading the Bible, that influenced you?

I’m not quite sure. Let me think about it.

I feel like I wasn't that committed in elementary school.
I still believed,
but maybe I didn't fully grasp it yet.

I think it was in grades 4 to 6 that I started taking my faith more seriously.
During that time, my parents would regularly teach me about the Bible,
kind of like private tutoring.
That really helped solidify my faith.

4) Lastly, what kind of events or circumstances might weaken a devout Christian's faith,
or even lead them to lose their belief?

Oh no, this question is so tricky!
As someone who is very religious, I find it hard to imagine.

Let me think…
Honestly, I can't really imagine it happening in my family.

But for others, I suppose a major life crisis might cause them to waver.
Although, sometimes major crises can actually lead people to faith too.

It depends on the person.
A big setback might make someone turn away from faith,
but for others, it might draw them closer.

I really can’t imagine what would happen if my family’s faith was shaken.
It's hard to picture.",1,,,,,"""A big setback might make someone turn away from faith, but for others, it might draw them closer."""
